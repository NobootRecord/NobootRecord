My name is Ivan Movchan, also known as NobootRecord. 15 years old. Russia, St. Petersburg :ru: \
I love coding random fun stuff using flat assembler, C/C++, Pascal, JavaScript/HTML and other programming languages.\
I also love music (I play piano) and video editing.\

That's all for now. Have a nice day!\
